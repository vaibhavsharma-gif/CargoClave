# Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in 2026: Navigating the Green Skies

## Executive Abstract

As the global aviation industry enters 2026, the transition from voluntary carbon offsets to mandatory sustainable fuel adoption has reached a critical tipping point. Driven by the European Union’s ReFuelEU mandates and the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has evolved from an experimental additive to a core operational requirement. However, this transition is fraught with challenges: from the "fat gap" in feedstock availability to the 3-5x price premium over conventional Jet A-1. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the SAF landscape in 2026, exploring the technical pathways, regulatory crucibles, and supply chain strategies that are defining the future of flight.

## 1. Introduction: The 2026 Climate Paradox

In 2026, the aviation industry finds itself at the heart of a profound climate paradox. While global air travel demand has surged back to and exceeded 2019 levels, the environmental scrutiny on the sector has never been higher. Commercial aviation is responsible for approximately 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, but when non-CO2 effects (such as contrails) are factored in, its total climate impact is significantly higher.

Unlike road transport, which is rapidly electrifying, long-haul aviation remains tethered to high-energy-density liquid fuels. Batteries simply lack the energy density required to lift a 200-ton aircraft across the Atlantic. Consequently, SAF is not just a "green option"; it is the *only* viable path to decarbonization for the vast majority of commercial flight operations. In 2026, we are seeing the end of the "experimentation phase" and the beginning of the "industrialization phase" of SAF.

## 2. The Regulatory Crucible: From Carrots to Sticks

The most defining characteristic of 2026 is the shift in regulatory posture. Governments have moved from offering "carrots" (incentives) to wielding "sticks" (mandates).

### 2.1 The European Union: ReFuelEU and the End of Free Allowances

2026 marks the first full year of the **ReFuelEU Aviation** mandates. Every fuel supplier at an EU airport is now legally required to ensure that at least 2% of their total fuel volume is SAF. While 2% sounds small, the logistics of injecting that volume across hundreds of airports are immense.

More critically, 2026 is the year free carbon allowances for airlines under the **EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)** are completely phased out. For the first time, airlines must pay for every ton of CO2 they emit. This has fundamentally changed the internal rate of return (IRR) for SAF investments; when the price of carbon exceeds €100/ton, the price gap between SAF and fossil fuel begins to close.

### 2.2 The United States: The 45Z Era

Across the Atlantic, the US continues to favor the "carrot" approach, but the intensity has scaled. The **SAF Grand Challenge** has matured, supported by the **45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit**. In 2026, SAF producers can receive tax credits up to $1.75 per gallon, depending on the lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction achieved. This has made the US the most attractive global market for SAF production, leading to a "renewable fuel gold rush" in the Midwest, where ethanol-to-jet (AtJ) facilities are proliferating.

### 2.3 Singapore and the Asia-Pacific Pivot

In 2026, Singapore has implemented its landmark **SAF Levy**. Rather than mandating a percentage, Singapore has placed a small, transparent fee on all departing tickets to fund the bulk purchase of SAF. This "socialized" approach to funding ensures that the cost of decarbonization is shared across the ecosystem, providing a stable offtake signal to producers in the ASEAN region.

## 3. Technical Pathways: Breaking Down the Feedstock Barrier

In 2026, SAF is produced via several ASTM-certified pathways, each with its own energy profile and scaling limitations.

### 3.1 HEFA: The Current Hegemon and the "Fat Gap"

The **Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)** pathway remains the dominant technology in 2026, accounting for over 85% of global SAF production. Using waste oils, greases, and animal fats, HEFA is the most technically mature and cost-effective method.

However, 2026 has seen the arrival of the "Fat Gap." The global demand for Used Cooking Oil (UCO) from the aviation, maritime, and road transport sectors has far outpaced supply. This has led to high price volatility in feedstock markets and increased scrutiny on the authenticity of waste oil sources, particularly from Southeast Asia.

### 3.2 Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ): The Ethanol Wave

2026 is the breakout year for **Alcohol-to-Jet**. With LanzaJet’s first commercial-scale facilities now fully operational, the industry is proving that low-carbon ethanol (derived from agricultural residues or industrial waste gases) can be efficiently converted into high-performance jet kerosene. AtJ is seen as the "bridge technology" that will allow the massive global corn and sugar ethanol industries to pivot toward aviation as road transport electrifies.

### 3.3 Power-to-Liquid (PtL): The 2026 Holy Grail

Commonly known as **e-SAF**, PtL involves combining green hydrogen with captured CO2. While it is the most sustainable pathway (potentially offering 95%+ GHG reduction), it remains the most expensive. In 2026, e-SAF is primarily used in small, high-profile "Green Corridors." The sub-mandates for e-SAF in Europe (starting in 2030) have triggered massive investment in 2026, with major energy firms breaking ground on multi-gigawatt electrolyzer plants in Norway, Chile, and Australia.

## 4. The Economic Barrier: Financing the Transition

Despite the mandates, the economics of SAF in 2026 remain challenging. SAF typically costs 3 to 5 times more than conventional Jet A-1.

### 4.1 The Price Premium and Ticket Inflation

For an industry that operates on razor-thin margins, the fuel cost increase is significant. In 2026, we are seeing the first signs of "green inflation" in airfares. On routes where SAF mandates are highest, ticket prices have risen by 3-5%. Airlines are grappling with how to pass these costs onto consumers without dampening the post-pandemic travel boom.

### 4.2 The Financing Gap

Building an e-SAF or AtJ plant requires hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenditure (CAPEX). In 2026, the primary hurdle for developers is securing **Final Investment Decisions (FID)**. Banks remain cautious about the long-term price stability of SAF. To solve this, we are seeing more "Offtake Alliances" where groups of airlines, corporate shippers, and freight forwarders jointly guarantee to buy SAF at a set price for 10-15 years.

## 5. Supply Chain & Logistics: The "Book and Claim" Revolution

The physical supply chain for SAF in 2026 is complex. Moving small volumes of SAF from production plants to remote airports is inefficient and carbon-intensive.

### 5.1 Drop-in Capability vs. Logistics Reality

SAF is a "drop-in" fuel, meaning it can be blended up to 50% with fossil jet fuel and used in existing engines. However, the physical blending of SAF usually happens at major fuel terminals or refinery gates, not at the aircraft wing.

### 5.2 Book and Claim

To overcome these logistics, the industry in 2026 has embraced the **Book and Claim** system. Under this model, a company pays for SAF to be injected into the fuel system at a high-production hub (like Houston or Rotterdam) but claims the carbon reduction benefit for their flights elsewhere. This ensures that the SAF is used as close to where it is produced as possible, minimizing transport emissions, while still providing the necessary funding for the transition.

## 6. Strategic Implications for Stakeholders

The SAF revolution is reshaping the roles within the logistics ecosystem.

* **For Shippers:** Scope 3 emissions reporting is now mandatory. Shippers are no longer just looking for the cheapest lane; they are looking for the "Greenest Lane."
* **For Airlines:** SAF procurement has moved from the sustainability department to the treasury. Fuel hedging now involves managing complex portfolios of carbon credits, SAF certificates, and physical fuel.
* **For Infrastructure Providers:** Airports are transforming into energy hubs. The demand for specialized SAF storage and blending infrastructure is a major driver of airport CAPEX in 2026.

## 7. Conclusion: The Road to 2030 and Beyond

2026 will be remembered as the year the aviation industry stopped talking about the future and started building it. The technical pathways are clear, the regulatory mandates are in place, and the capital is beginning to flow. However, the scale of the challenge remains immense. To meet 2030 targets, global SAF production must increase by nearly 1,000% from 2026 levels.

Success will depend on three things:

1. **Feedstock Diversification**: Moving beyond HEFA to waste-to-energy and PtL.
2. **Harmonized Policy**: Avoiding a fragmented global landscape of conflicting mandates.
3. **Customer Transparency**: Ensuring that the travelers and shippers who pay the "green premium" can see exactly how their money is decarbonizing the skies.

As we look toward the second half of the decade, the question is no longer *if* aviation can go green, but *how fast* it can scale to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. In 2026, the takeoff roll has begun.
